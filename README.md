# Co-Creative-Robot
Today's robotic technologies are not only used in industries but are applicable in our day-to-day life. Since therapy robots have been playing a very prominent role in todayâ€™s modern world, we have planned at creating a robotic arm that could help the kids with a disability to draw along and build self-confidence in them. For this purpose, we train a co-creative robotic arm to be able to process the input in the form of speech, sketch and update the image according to the user given feedback is the aim behind this project. We have used Google's quick draw data set as an initial training data for the robotic arm. The feedback can be given by the kids in the form of voice, as the sketches are drawn by the robotic arm that can then be trained to suit the needs of the kid and make more creative and personalized drawings.
